  List:
  - Name: 
    Sentences:
    - I'd question the Doc's methods, but holy dooley! They work!
  - Name: 
    Sentences:
    - How good it feels to breathe such a clean air! You can be sure there are Pockets
      here just be seein' how vivid this forest is. Let's hope we can bring such
      life to our sanctuary.
  - Name: 
    Sentences:
    - I'd really love to hold some beautiful specimens that live here, but their
      spikes, fangs and hostility tells me to respect their personal space!
  - Name: 
    Sentences:
    - Knock that look, mate! Don't judge me for liking this place.
  - Name: 
    Sentences:
    - Mate, it gives you chiils when the smillin' one opens its eye, don't you think?
      I was stonkered when it teleported behind me!
  - Name: 
    Sentences:
    - Amazing! The creature that stalks the walls has a projectile that envelops
      you in place with vines! I've struggled to set myself free and had to dash
      through it before another one could hit me. I wonder why it had to evolve like
      that...
  - Name: 
    Sentences:
    - This blind snake's body is cactus! Literally! So watch your step.
  - Name: 
    Sentences:
    - Crickey! I'd spend the entire day shooting the swarm of bities with my pistol
      if I hadn't run! Guess it was a poor choice of weapon for such an enemy.
  - Name: 
    Sentences:
    - It hurts me, mate. Taking life in order to save life. But such is the way of
      the Balance.
  - Name: 
    Sentences:
    - The monsters we see 'round these places sure are well-adapted to their environment.
      Just how much time they had to evolve?
  - Name: 
    Sentences:
    - I don't know, mate, something's off. All of the monsters we see around here
      are natural killing machines- but yet, they don't have a single predator, nor
      do they brawl with each other. Why are they so well-versed in defending themselves
      then?
  - Name: 
    Sentences:
    - Have you seen all those vines that covers this forest's floor? They seem to
      come from a single entity! Let's keep our pace and see if we can find it.
  - Name: 
    Sentences:
    - Oy, mate, not gonna lie, this forest here really is the kinda place I could
      spend my life on. What a beauty!
  - Name: 
    Sentences:
    - See those flappin' plant-birds? Shot them with a fast weapon or it will just
      dodge all your projectiles!
  - Name: 
    Sentences:
    - I did some research, mate, and all of these creatures share the same DNA. I'm
      afraid of what I'll find...
