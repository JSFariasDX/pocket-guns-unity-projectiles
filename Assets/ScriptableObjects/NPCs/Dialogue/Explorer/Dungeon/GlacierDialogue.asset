  List:
  - Name: 
    Sentences:
    - Have you seen the fauna that lives here? Why do they stagger when charging
      in your direction? There must be a reason...
  - Name: 
    Sentences:
    - ...and there I was, bored with all this white canvas of a place, when I realized
      I was already knee-deep in trouble! There are some animals in this place that
      blends with the scenery.
  - Name: 
    Sentences:
    - This place's so full of snow that the fall of a jumpin' one sends projectiles
      everywhere! Careful not to be hit, mate.
  - Name: 
    Sentences:
    - We're basically on a island! There's just water beneath us. It makes me wonder
      what kind of amazing beings dwell in there.
  - Name: 
    Sentences:
    - Oy, mate! You're a Caretaker, innit? Seems like your kind left behind some
      reactors to heat up the place when they first uncovered here. Since you still
      carry the same weapons as them, I guess the ones you wield could still charge
      them up.
  - Name: 
    Sentences:
    - ...maybe if I could build a small reactor we could keep ourselves from getting
      frozen here all the time...
  - Name: 
    Sentences:
    - Something doesn't fit here. The Pocket-Mor told us the creatures stole the
      eggs, but for what purpose? They don't eat it- truth be told, I haven't seen
      they do anything with them at all!
  - Name: 
    Sentences:
    - 'I''ve glimpsed a creature getting too close to the egg located in this glacier.
      A kraken of sorts quickly rose from it''s slumber and sent it flying. Does
      the kraken treasure it''s possession or does it protect it from harm? I don''t
      understand... '
  - Name: 
    Sentences:
    - I might be small, I might be weak, but I need to get to the end of this.
  - Name: 
    Sentences:
    - So many entries... So much story...
  - Name: 
    Sentences:
    - I've managed to translate a few entries already, mate, and I can see the words
      Caretaker and Mor repeated all over!
  - Name: 
    Sentences:
    - I've run some tests and the water below us is kilometers deep! Imagine what
      kind of amazing beings must dwell in such an ocean...
  - Name: 
    Sentences:
    - The elevator's locked. We'll need some sort of keys to unlock it.
