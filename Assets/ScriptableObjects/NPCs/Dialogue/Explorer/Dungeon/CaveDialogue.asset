  - Name: 
    Sentences:
    - Careful, mate! We are on treacherous terrain! I can't see a single ray of sun
      'round here. Maybe there's a way to light our way here...
  - Name: 
    Sentences:
    - Crickey! I got lost inside a room with monsters chasing me and started blasting
      everywhere. For some reason, some green rocks started to shine. Let's see if
      I can discover what triggered it.
  - Name: 
    Sentences:
    - The creatures around here seems to shine a faintly glow. Use it to your advantage
      and shoot them before they reach you!
  - Name: 
    Sentences:
    - I love snakes as much as the next person, but snakes even on a cavern?! Holy
      dooley, that's too much!
  - Name: 
    Sentences:
    - Watch you step, mate, the snakes 'round here will hurt a lot to step on, even
      when defeated.
  - Name: 
    Sentences:
    - I'm stonkered! I swear I could see a shadow watching me!
  - Name: 
    Sentences:
    - The green crystals 'round here seem to be able to produce light. Let's see
      if I can create a sort of a lantern.
  - Name: 
    Sentences:
    - I can see some weapons and items scattered 'round those places. Meet me near
      the elevator and I'll give you something!
  - Name: 
    Sentences:
    - Have you seen the fire one, mate? It bounces from place to place but always
      sticks somewhere for a while. Hit it while you can!
  - Name: 
    Sentences:
    - 'Whoa there! Have you heard those rumblings? It looks like the place will fall,
      but it seems quite stable. '
  - Name: 
    Sentences:
    - Explosions seem to shake the entire place up!
  - Name: 
    Sentences:
    - It makes no sense, but a shadow's been following me! No matter where I shot,
      it never seemed to hurt it. Maybe there's a catch to it...
  - Name: 
    Sentences:
    - Those creatures, they don't fight us for survival or pleasure, they seem to
      be protecting something. Could it be the egg?
  - Name: 
    Sentences:
    - Are we truly doing the right thing, mate?
