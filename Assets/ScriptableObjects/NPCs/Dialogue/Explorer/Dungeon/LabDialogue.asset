  - Name: 
    Sentences:
    - Those monsters are the most wondrous beings I've seen in my life. Tell me,
      mate, are we trully serving the Balance by slayin' them?
  - Name: 
    Sentences:
    - I almost lost my hat once when a Armored charged me. Good thing I dashed outta
      danger at the right moment!
  - Name: 
    Sentences:
    - Something feels off, don't you think? I feel like there's a missing piece to
      all this quest. Let's pray that the Balance be served right.
  - Name: 
    Sentences:
    - Hatred is just another enemy to be faced, even though internally. Don't hate
      the monsters, but remember to do what must be done, they stole our eggs!
  - Name: 
    Sentences:
    - Seek the Balance in all things, questing one. No one should take a larger piece
      of the right to live.
  - Name: 
    Sentences:
    - Oy, mate! You don't need to face it all alone. I'm with you to the end.
  - Name: 
    Sentences:
    - Crikey! Careful with the jumping ones! You can always count on their shadow
      to tell where they'll fall.
  - Name: 
    Sentences:
    - I've been running some tests on the Protection Pockets and they really protect
      you from everything, mate! Even some sorts of vampirism. Maybe that will come
      in handy sometime for you.
  - Name: 
    Sentences:
    - Whoa there, mate! Have you seen the Queen who slumbers beyond the locked elevator?
      It seems really ferocious towards anyone approaching it's egg, almost as if
      it treasures it, innit?
  - Name: 
    Sentences:
    - Has the Pocket-Mor told you why the monsters took our eggs? I guess I didn't
      pay attention at the moment and the information slipped me.
  - Name: 
    Sentences:
    - It is natural for animals to steal eggs in order to survive, but I doubt these
      monsters think of anything but cruelty!
  - Name: 
    Sentences:
    - My mother told me to always seek the Balance in all things, and you know what?
      These monsters really think they can tip it in their favor. Let's show them
      otherwise.
  - Name: 
    Sentences:
    - Have you seen the burrowing one, mate? Be weary when they come out of the ground
      and shoot em'! Remember, watch you step.
  - Name: 
    Sentences:
    - The smiling ones really send chills down your spine, innit? They look really
      cruel, but I swear I could see one crying while trying to click buttons on
      one of those machines.
  - Name: 
    Sentences:
    - I've no ideia of who used to use these machines scatered 'round here, but I
      guess they were of your size, mate.
  - Name: 
    Sentences:
    - 'Let me give you the drum, mate: the Sinister Merchant asks for more than mere
      coins. Beware it''s price!'
  - Name: 
    Sentences:
    - It's strange, innit? The monsters' biology makes no sense at all! You can't
      distinguish between male and female and they don't seem to be able to reproduce.
      How were they made in the first place? Sure, we call the big one the Queen,
      but it is only because it follows the biological pattern of hive queens.
  - Name: 
    Sentences:
    - I've managed to decode one of the computers. I'm still trying to translate
      the texts, though.
  - Name: 
    Sentences:
    - All of the computers display the same text file. Let's see if I can work on
      a translation.
